For this project we decided to use the mushroom data from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. This data includes descrptions of samples to 23 species of gilled mushrooms in ithe Agaricus and Lepitoa family. Each species is identifieed as a definitely edible, definitely poisonous, or of unkown edibility. There are 22 attributes for each mushroom. And the data are just letters corresponding to a chart that they provide. But in our data we renamed them our selves to make it easier to read. 

In the following graphs, we show the number of mushrooms with a given cap color separated into two groups: poisonous mushrooms and edible mushrooms.

To produce our graphs we went through these steps. 

1. First we did a full joined on all the data 
```{r}
source('../01 Data/data.R', echo = TRUE)
```

2. Added the column names and mushroom ID through excel
Exported as .csv

3. Wrote our own code in R to format the data.

4.Removed all spaces and replaced with underscore

5. Changed all data inside each attribute to their corresponding name
        ie. Cap Color N would equal Brown..

```{r}
source('../02 Data Wrangling/reformatting.R', echo = TRUE)
```



# Rank
The last column shows the rank of the cap colors in each group. Here we found out that the most popular color is brown shared between both groups of edible and poisonous.

# Habitat
Here, we are showing the diffrent types of habitats that the mushrrooms grow in. From this data we found out that most of the mushrooms you find on paths you walk on is poisonous.

# Odors
This graph shows the odor the diffrent types of odor the mushrooms produce. Here we found out that the nice smelling mushrooms are edible while the bad smelling ones is poisonous.

# Habitats and Cap Color
Here we combined habitats and color. One intresting thing we found from this graph is that 100% of white mushrooms found in urban areas are poisonous.
